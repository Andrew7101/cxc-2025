** Effect of Operational Offsets on Sales**

Explore whether this offset correlates with total daily sales, tips, or order volumes, potentially indicatingdifferent peak operational hours.


**Holiday or Day-of-Week Impact on Sales**

Examine how total daily sales vary during different holidays or days of the week. 
Also explore whether weekends generate higher net sales, tips, or gratuities compared to weekdays.
